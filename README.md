# AI Scholars Hackathon Challenge

To help those with disabilities and those in stress my team and I create an alexa skill to put them in a calming routine.

The skill simply goes through counting and breathing techniques that are proven to calm people in stressed states.

It also pulls audio from online to calm the user more.
